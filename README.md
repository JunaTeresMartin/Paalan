# Paalan
Paalan is an online platform for Anganwadis. We have a lot of Aganwadis near 
us, but we are not able to access them. There are a lot of schemes related to 
Anganwadi that are beneficial for everyone, but not everybody is able to 
access them. It's because of the lack of communication. In order to reduce this 
issue, we came up with a solution called Paalan.
 Paalan helps in managing stock and admissions related 
to Anganwadi and helps in communicating with people about the new 
schemes. It will contain information about the stock availability in each 
Anganwadi in each location, it will be useful for the local government bodies 
regarding the supply needs information. It will help them recognize the 
stock that is not being utilized and identify the region where there is a lack of 
stock and transport the balance or extra stock into that particular region. There 
will be a chat system provided on the site that will help them recognize 
whether the stock is there. For that we use a user-friendly color coordinating 
mechanism that can be used by workers who have low technical skills. If the 
sender sends a message in red, the stock has set sail. If the receiver gives a 
green message, that means the stock level has been reached and there is no 
problem with the stock. If they send an orange message," this means the stock 
has some defects. This application has a bot called "Sevak," which tells about 
new schemes and services provided. It is available in all languages. Paalan also 
provides notifications about all the new schemes and asks the users to collect 
their materials
